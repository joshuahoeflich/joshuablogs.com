title: Lisp as an Obvious Idea
description: When building this website, I decided to roll my own static site generator. Using TypeScript, I wrote a 300 line program to compile some Markdown files and a few hand-hacked static assets into a series of directories and HTML files that any server could potentially host. The "apps" page exists to host projects written in JavaScript or various other languages that compile into it, but this blog section doesn't use any scripts. All I needed was the bricks of the web, and maybe that's all you need, too.
