        <h1>Joshua Blogs</h1>
        <p>Hello, there! Thank you for coming to my corner of the internet.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a programmer from Chicago studying computer science at
          Northwestern University. Before that, I worked as an engineer at a
          couple startups and earned a degree in English education. In my spare
          time, I like to write, sing, walk, and read Russian literature.

          This website serves as a convenient place to publish essays and small
          web programs that I find interesting. If you're curious about how I
          created it,

          I love web development. The internet is a miraculous but extremely
          complicated place, and I aim to make using it as delightful as
          possible. I particularly enjoy writing performant, responsive, and
          intuitive websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          At work, I've put a fair amount of JavaScript and Go code into
          production. I have experience building and deploying microservices
          onto AWS and working with the serverless technologies that platform
          offers. I'm comfortable working with React, Redux, graphql APIs, and
          the modern JAMStack ecosystem more generally.

          used a variety of different languages and tools. When I have the
          oppertunity to do so, I enjoy working with LISP dialects, especially
          Racket and Clojure.
